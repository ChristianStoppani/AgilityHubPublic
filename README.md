# Agility Hub (Public)

Welcome!

This public directory contains the code of my bachelor thesis.

The WebApp follows the typical structure of a Next.js project:

**Pages** contains the main scripts for the pages visualised by the user as well as the APIs

**Styles** contains the CCS files associated to those pages

**Components** contains chunks of code which are reused across the website, along with the respective css

**schema.prisma** contains the schema used by Prisma, the ORM that facilitates interaction between the app and the actual database

*Note: this is just a part of the real app for those interested in diving into the code*
